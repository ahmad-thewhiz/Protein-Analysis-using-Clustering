# Protein-Analysis-using-Clustering

On a dataset consisting of 50 Ã— 324 units of numeric data, hierarchical clustering was performed using the Pearson distance approach on 25 pairs of E. coli Two-Component Systems (TCS) and their fitness scores under 324 distinct conditions. After successfully completing the hierarchical clustering, the result was obtained in the form of a dendrogram, where proteins identified by the algorithm as having similarity were clustered together.
